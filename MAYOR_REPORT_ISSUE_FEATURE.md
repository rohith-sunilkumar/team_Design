# 🏛️ Mayor Report Issue Feature

## Overview

Added "Report Issue" button to the mayor's navbar, allowing mayors to submit reports. All reports created by mayors are automatically assigned **HIGH priority** to ensure urgent attention from departments.

---

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Navbar - Desktop (Lines 93-98)

**File**: `/client/src/components/Navbar.jsx`

Added "Report Issue" button to mayor's desktop navigation:

```javascript
{user?.role === 'mayor' ? (
  <>
    <Link to="/mayor/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
    <Link
      to="/report"
      className="bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-xl font-semibold hover:from-violet-700 hover:to-purple-700 transition-all duration-300 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl hover:scale-105 transform"
    >
      Report Issue
    </Link>
    <Link to="/admin/reports">All Reports</Link>
  </>
) : ...
```

#### 2. Navbar - Mobile (Lines 553-560)

Added "Report Issue" button to mayor's mobile menu:

```javascript
<Link
  to="/report"
  onClick={() => setMobileMenuOpen(false)}
  className="flex items-center space-x-2 px-3 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold"
>
  <FileText className="h-5 w-5" />
  <span>Report Issue</span>
</Link>
```

#### 3. Route Configuration (Line 84)

**File**: `/client/src/App.jsx`

Updated `/report` route to allow all authenticated users including mayors:

```javascript
<Route
  path="/report"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allRoles>  {/* Changed from citizenOnly */}
      <ReportIssue />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

---

### Backend Changes

#### Automatic High Priority for Mayor Reports

**File**: `/server/routes/departmentReports.js` (Lines 71-78)

Added logic to automatically set priority to "high" for mayor-created reports:

```javascript
const { category, department } = aiResult;
let { priority } = aiResult;

// If the reporter is a mayor, automatically set priority to high
if (req.user.role === 'mayor') {
  priority = 'high';
  console.log('👑 Mayor report detected - Priority automatically set to HIGH');
}
```

---

## How It Works

### Mayor Report Submission Flow:

```
Mayor clicks "Report Issue" button
    ↓
Navigate to /report page
    ↓
Mayor fills out report form:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Category
  - Location
  - Upload images (optional)
    ↓
Submit report
    ↓
Backend receives report
    ↓
Check if user.role === 'mayor'
    ↓
✅ Automatically set priority = 'high'
    ↓
Save report to department collection
    ↓
Report created with HIGH priority
    ↓
Department admins see high-priority report
```

## Priority Logic

### For Citizens:
- Priority determined by AI classification
- Can be: low, medium, or high
- Based on issue severity and keywords

### For Admins:
- Priority determined by AI classification
- Can be: low, medium, or high
- Based on issue severity and keywords

### For Mayors:
- **Always HIGH priority** 👑
- Overrides AI classification
- Ensures urgent department attention
- Logged in console for tracking

## Priority Indicators

### In UI:

**High Priority (Mayor Reports):**
```
🔴 High Priority
- Red badge
- Appears at top of lists
- Urgent attention indicator
```

**Medium Priority:**
```
🟡 Medium Priority
- Yellow badge
- Standard processing
```

**Low Priority:**
```
🟢 Low Priority
- Green badge
- Normal queue
```

---

## Console Logging

When a mayor submits a report, the backend logs:

```
👑 Mayor report detected - Priority automatically set to HIGH
📝 Creating report in {department} collection
```

This helps with:
- Tracking mayor-initiated reports
- Debugging priority assignment
- Monitoring system usage
- Audit trail

---

## Database Structure

Reports created by mayors are stored with:

```javascript
{
  title: "Report title",
  description: "Report description",
  category: "road/water/etc",
  priority: "high",  // ✅ Automatically set for mayors
  reporter: mayorUserId,
  department: "assigned_department",
  status: "open",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  // ... other fields
}
```
