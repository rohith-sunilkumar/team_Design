# 🐛 Mayor Chat System Bug Fix

## Problem Identified

The mayor's chat system was not working correctly. The mayor could not see chats directed to the mayor's office.

### Root Cause

In `/server/routes/chat.js`, the `GET /api/chat/department-chats` endpoint had an incorrect query for the mayor role.

**Original Code (Line 183-185):**
```javascript
const query = req.user.role === 'mayor' 
  ? { status: 'active' }
  : { department: req.user.department, status: 'active' };
```

**Issue:** 
- The query `{ status: 'active' }` would return ALL active chats in the database
- This was too broad and didn't specifically target chats relevant to the mayor
- The mayor needs to see:
  1. Chats directed **TO** the mayor's office (`department: 'mayor_office'`)
  2. Chats started **BY** the mayor to other departments

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code (Lines 182-194):
```javascript
// Mayor sees chats directed to mayor_office OR started by mayor
// Admin sees only their department chats
let query;
if (req.user.role === 'mayor') {
  query = {
    $or: [
      { department: 'mayor_office', status: 'active' }, // Chats TO mayor
      { userId: req.user._id, status: 'active' }        // Chats FROM mayor
    ]
  };
} else {
  query = { department: req.user.department, status: 'active' };
}
```

### What Changed:
1. **Added $or query** for mayor role to handle two scenarios:
   - `department: 'mayor_office'` - Shows chats where citizens/admins are contacting the mayor
   - `userId: req.user._id` - Shows chats where the mayor initiated contact with departments

2. **Maintained admin logic** - Admins still only see chats for their specific department

## How It Works Now

### For Mayor:
```
Mayor logs in → Calls /api/chat/department-chats
    ↓
Backend checks: user.role === 'mayor'
    ↓
Query: { $or: [
  { department: 'mayor_office', status: 'active' },
  { userId: mayorId, status: 'active' }
]}
    ↓
Returns: 
  - All chats TO mayor's office (from citizens/admins)
  - All chats FROM mayor (to any department)
```

### For Admin:
```
Admin logs in → Calls /api/chat/department-chats
    ↓
Backend checks: user.role === 'admin'
    ↓
Query: { department: admin.department, status: 'active' }
    ↓
Returns: Only chats for their specific department
```

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Citizen Chats with Mayor
1. Citizen logs in
2. Starts new chat, selects "🏛️ Mayor Office"
3. Sends message to mayor
4. **Expected**: Mayor sees this chat in their chat list

### ✅ Test 2: Mayor Chats with Department
1. Mayor logs in
2. Starts new chat, selects a department (e.g., "Road Service")
3. Sends message to department
4. **Expected**: 
   - Mayor sees this chat in their list
   - Road Service admin sees this chat in their list

### ✅ Test 3: Admin Chats with Mayor
1. Admin (e.g., Road Service) logs in
2. Starts new chat, selects "🏛️ Mayor Office"
3. Sends message to mayor
4. **Expected**: Mayor sees this chat in their chat list

## Related Files Modified

- **`/server/routes/chat.js`** (Lines 182-194)
  - Fixed the department-chats query for mayor role

## Additional Notes

### Frontend Validation
The frontend (`/client/src/pages/Chat.jsx`) correctly prevents the mayor from selecting "Mayor Office" when starting a new chat (lines 378-380), which is appropriate since the mayor shouldn't chat with themselves.

### Database Schema
The Chat model (`/server/models/Chat.js`) supports the `mayor_office` department value in the enum (line 56), so no database changes were needed.

### Access Control
The chat access control in other routes (send message, get chat, etc.) already correctly allows mayor access to all chats (lines 100, 233), so those didn't need changes.

---

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Mayor chat system now working correctly

The mayor can now:
- ✅ See all chats directed to mayor's office
- ✅ See all chats they initiated with departments
- ✅ Send and receive messages in all relevant chats
- ✅ Access full chat history

---

## Deployment Notes

- No database migration required
- No frontend changes needed
- Backend automatically reloaded with nodemon
- Change is backward compatible
