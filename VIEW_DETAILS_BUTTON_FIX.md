# 🐛 View Details Button Fix

## Problem Identified

The "View Details" button on report cards wasn't working for citizens - clicking it would not navigate to the report detail page.

### Root Cause

In `/client/src/App.jsx`, the `/reports/:id` route was using `<ProtectedRoute adminOrMayor>` which blocked citizens from viewing their own report details.

**Original Code (Line 111):**
```javascript
<Route
  path="/reports/:id"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute adminOrMayor>  {/* ❌ Blocked citizens */}
      <ReportDetail />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

**Issue:**
The `adminOrMayor` flag only allows admins and mayors to access the route, preventing citizens from viewing details of their own reports.

**Result:** When citizens clicked "View Details" on their reports, they were redirected instead of seeing the report details page.

## Solution Implemented

Changed the route to use `allRoles` flag to allow all authenticated users to view report details.

**Fixed Code (Line 111):**
```javascript
<Route
  path="/reports/:id"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute allRoles>  {/* ✅ All authenticated users */}
      <ReportDetail />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

## How It Works Now

### Navigation Flow for Citizen:
```
Citizen clicks "View Details" on their report
    ↓
Navigate to /reports/{reportId}
    ↓
ProtectedRoute checks: allRoles flag is TRUE
    ↓
User is authenticated (citizen)
    ↓
✅ Report detail page loads successfully
```

### Navigation Flow for Admin:
```
Admin clicks "View Details" on any report
    ↓
Navigate to /reports/{reportId}
    ↓
ProtectedRoute checks: allRoles flag is TRUE
    ↓
User is authenticated (admin)
    ↓
✅ Report detail page loads successfully
```

### Navigation Flow for Mayor:
```
Mayor clicks "View Details" on any report
    ↓
Navigate to /reports/{reportId}
    ↓
ProtectedRoute checks: allRoles flag is TRUE
    ↓
User is authenticated (mayor)
    ↓
✅ Report detail page loads successfully
```
