## Special Cases Handled

### Cards with Light Backgrounds
Some components use light-colored cards or sections:
- `bg-primary-50` (light purple/blue)
- `bg-blue-50` (light blue)
- `bg-yellow-50` (light yellow)
- `bg-green-50` (light green)

These require **dark text** colors (text-gray-600, text-gray-700, text-gray-800, text-gray-900)

### Status Badges
Status badges have their own color schemes with proper contrast:
- `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` (Open)
- `bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800` (In Progress)
- `bg-green-100 text-green-800` (Resolved)
- `bg-gray-100 text-gray-800` (Closed)

These were kept as-is since they already have proper contrast.

## Testing Recommendations

Test these pages for text visibility:
1. ✅ Admin Dashboard - Analytics section
2. ✅ Admin Reports - Report cards and edit forms
3. ✅ User Dashboard - Filter buttons
4. ✅ My Reports - Empty state
5. ✅ Report Detail - All sections including AI classification
6. ✅ Report Issue - Form hints and success message
7. ✅ Mayor Dashboard - Edit modal

## Consistency Check

All dark-themed cards (using the `.card` class) now use:
- Headings: `text-gray-100`
- Body text: `text-gray-200` or `text-gray-300`
- Secondary text: `text-gray-400`
- Hover states: `hover:text-gray-200` or `hover:text-gray-100`

All light-themed sections use:
- Headings: `text-gray-800` or `text-gray-900`
- Body text: `text-gray-700`
- Secondary text: `text-gray-600`
