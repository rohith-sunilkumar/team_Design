# 🎯 AI Visual Analyzer Integration - Complete

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue:** Report "leg broken" was being classified as "General Department" instead of "Hospital Emergency"

**Solution:** Integrated the Local Visual Analyzer into the report submission form with real-time analysis

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time AI Analysis**
- Analyzes text as user types (title + description + location)
- Debounced to avoid excessive API calls (1 second delay)
- Shows "Analyzing..." indicator while processing

### 2. **AI Suggestion UI**
- Beautiful gradient card showing:
  - **Suggested Department** (e.g., "Hospital Emergency")
  - **Priority Level** (High/Medium/Low with color coding)
  - **Confidence Score** (percentage)
  - **Reasoning** (why it was classified this way)
- "Accept Suggestion" button to auto-fill department

### 3. **Updated Department Options**
Changed from generic departments to match Visual Analyzer categories:
- ✅ Roads & Infrastructure
- ✅ Hospital Emergency (instead of "Hospital Emergency Department")
- ✅ Water Supply
- ✅ Street Lighting & Electricity
- ✅ Sanitation & Waste
- ✅ Drainage & Sewage
- ✅ Environment & Parks
- ✅ Construction & Public Safety
- ✅ Public Property Damage
- ✅ Animal Control
- ✅ Traffic Management
- ✅ Other Civic Issue

### 4. **Health Priority Rules**
All health-related keywords trigger **HIGH priority**:
- medical, hospital, emergency, ambulance
- accident, injury, injured, hurt, wounded
- disease, infection, contamination
- sanitation, hygiene, sewage
- And 20+ more health keywords
