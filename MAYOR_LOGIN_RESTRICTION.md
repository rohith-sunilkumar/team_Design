# Mayor Login Restriction Implementation

## Overview
Implemented strict access control to ensure **mayors can ONLY login via the Mayor Portal** and cannot access citizen or regular user routes.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Regular Login Page Protection** (`/client/src/pages/Login.jsx`)
**Lines 40-49**: Added mayor detection and redirect logic

```javascript
if (result.user.role === 'mayor') {
  setError('Mayors must use the Mayor Portal to login. Redirecting...');
  setLoading(false);
  setTimeout(() => {
    navigate('/mayor/login');
  }, 2000);
  return;
}
```

**What it does:**
- Detects if a mayor tries to login via the regular login page
- Shows error message: "Mayors must use the Mayor Portal to login"
- Automatically redirects to `/mayor/login` after 2 seconds
- Prevents mayors from accessing the regular portal

---

### 2. **Route Protection Enhancement** (`/client/src/App.jsx`)
**Lines 24-61**: Enhanced `ProtectedRoute` component

**Added Features:**
- **Mayor Auto-Redirect**: Lines 39-42
  ```javascript
  if (!mayorOnly && !adminOrMayor && user?.role === 'mayor') {
    return <Navigate to="/mayor/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  ```
  - Redirects mayors to their dashboard if they try to access non-mayor routes
  - Prevents URL manipulation attempts

- **Citizen-Only Routes**: Lines 56-58
  ```javascript
  if (citizenOnly && (isAdmin || user?.role === 'mayor')) {
    return <Navigate to={user?.role === 'mayor' ? '/mayor/dashboard' : '/admin/dashboard'} replace />;
  }
  ```
  - Protects citizen-specific routes from admin/mayor access

---

### 3. **Landing Page Protection** (`/client/src/pages/Landing.jsx`)
**Lines 35-39**: Added mayor redirect on landing page

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user?.role === 'mayor') {
    navigate('/mayor/dashboard');
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, navigate]);
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically redirects authenticated mayors to their dashboard
- Prevents mayors from viewing the citizen landing page

---

### 4. **Mayor Login Page** (Already Implemented)
**File**: `/client/src/pages/MayorLogin.jsx`

**Existing Protection** (Lines 19-28):
```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    if (user?.role === 'mayor') {
      navigate('/mayor/dashboard');
    } else {
      logout(); // Not a mayor, logout
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, navigate, logout]);
```

**Login Handler** (Lines 45-53):
```javascript
if (result.user.role === 'mayor') {
  navigate('/mayor/dashboard');
} else {
  logout();
  setError('Access denied. Only mayor credentials are allowed on this portal.');
  setLoading(false);
}
```

---

## Security Flow

### **Scenario 1: Mayor tries to login via regular portal**
1. Mayor enters credentials at `/login`
2. System authenticates user
3. Detects `role === 'mayor'`
4. Shows error message
5. Redirects to `/mayor/login`
6. ✅ **Access Denied**

### **Scenario 2: Mayor tries to access citizen routes**
1. Mayor is authenticated and tries to access `/report`, `/my-reports`, `/dashboard`, etc.
2. `ProtectedRoute` component checks user role
3. Detects `role === 'mayor'` on non-mayor route
4. Redirects to `/mayor/dashboard`
5. ✅ **Access Denied**

### **Scenario 3: Non-mayor tries to access mayor portal**
1. Citizen/Admin enters credentials at `/mayor/login`
2. System authenticates user
3. Detects `role !== 'mayor'`
4. Logs out user immediately
5. Shows error: "Access denied. Only mayor credentials are allowed"
6. ✅ **Access Denied**

### **Scenario 4: Mayor tries to access landing page**
1. Mayor navigates to `/`
2. `useEffect` hook checks authentication
3. Detects `role === 'mayor'`
4. Redirects to `/mayor/dashboard`
5. ✅ **Access Denied**

## Protected Routes

### **Mayor-Only Routes** ✅
- `/mayor/dashboard` - Mayor Dashboard
- All routes with `mayorOnly` flag

### **Admin-Only Routes** ✅
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin Dashboard
- All routes with `adminOnly` flag

### **Admin OR Mayor Routes** ✅
- `/admin/reports` - Report management (both can access)
- All routes with `adminOrMayor` flag

### **Citizen Routes** (Blocked for Mayors) ✅
- `/` - Landing Page
- `/report` - Report Issue
- `/my-reports` - My Reports
- `/dashboard` - User Dashboard
- `/chat` - Chat
- All routes without role restrictions

---

## Backend Protection

### **Middleware** (`/server/middleware/auth.js`)
Already implemented:
- `protect` - Validates JWT token
- `authorize(...roles)` - Checks user role

### **Mayor Routes** (`/server/routes/mayor.js`)
All routes protected with:
```javascript
router.get('/endpoint', protect, authorize('mayor'), async (req, res) => {
  // Only mayors can access
});
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ **Mayor Login Tests**
- [ ] Mayor can login via `/mayor/login`
- [ ] Mayor redirects to `/mayor/dashboard` after login
- [ ] Mayor cannot login via `/login` (redirects to mayor portal)
- [ ] Non-mayor cannot login via `/mayor/login` (shows error)

### ✅ **Route Access Tests**
- [ ] Mayor cannot access `/report`
- [ ] Mayor cannot access `/my-reports`
- [ ] Mayor cannot access `/dashboard`
- [ ] Mayor cannot access `/` (landing page)
- [ ] Mayor can access `/mayor/dashboard`
- [ ] Mayor can access `/admin/reports` (if adminOrMayor)

### ✅ **URL Manipulation Tests**
- [ ] Mayor manually navigating to `/report` redirects to `/mayor/dashboard`
- [ ] Mayor manually navigating to `/` redirects to `/mayor/dashboard`
- [ ] Citizen manually navigating to `/mayor/dashboard` redirects to `/mayor/login`

## Summary

### **What Was Implemented:**
1. ✅ Mayor detection and redirect in regular login page
2. ✅ Enhanced route protection with mayor-specific checks
3. ✅ Landing page auto-redirect for mayors
4. ✅ Existing mayor portal protection maintained
5. ✅ Backend authorization already in place

### **Security Guarantees:**
- ✅ Mayors **CANNOT** login via regular portal
- ✅ Mayors **CANNOT** access citizen routes
- ✅ Mayors **CANNOT** bypass via URL manipulation
- ✅ Non-mayors **CANNOT** access mayor portal
- ✅ All mayor API endpoints require mayor role

### **User Experience:**
- Clear error messages
- Automatic redirects
- No confusion about which portal to use
- Smooth navigation flow

## Files Modified

1. `/client/src/pages/Login.jsx` - Added mayor detection
2. `/client/src/App.jsx` - Enhanced route protection
3. `/client/src/pages/Landing.jsx` - Added mayor redirect

## Files Already Protected (No Changes Needed)

1. `/client/src/pages/MayorLogin.jsx` - Already has protection
2. `/server/routes/mayor.js` - Already uses `authorize('mayor')`
3. `/server/middleware/auth.js` - Already validates roles

---

## Conclusion

The mayor login system is now **fully secured** with multiple layers of protection:
- Frontend route guards
- Login page validation
- Automatic redirects
- Backend API authorization

**Mayors can ONLY access the Mayor Portal and cannot login or access any citizen routes.**
