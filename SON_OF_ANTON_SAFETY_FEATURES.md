This is a medical/safety emergency. I am an AI assistant and cannot 
provide emergency medical care. You need immediate professional help.

What to do RIGHT NOW:
1. Call emergency services immediately (112 or 108)
2. Stay calm and follow dispatcher instructions
3. Do NOT drive yourself if you're the one injured
4. If someone else is injured, stay with them until help arrives

After calling emergency services:
If this is a civic infrastructure emergency (gas leak, fire, electrical 
hazard), you can report it through the portal AFTER you've called 
emergency services and are safe.
