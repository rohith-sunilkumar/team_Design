# üêõ Mayor Report Issue & My Reports Buttons Fix

## Problem Identified

The mayor's "Report Issue" and "My Reports" buttons were not working. Clicking them would redirect the mayor back to the dashboard.

### Root Cause

In `/client/src/App.jsx`, the `/report` and `/my-reports` routes were using `<ProtectedRoute>` without the `citizenOnly` flag.

**Original Code:**
```javascript
<Route
  path="/report"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>  // ‚ùå No flag specified
      <ReportIssue />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>

<Route
  path="/my-reports"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>  // ‚ùå No flag specified
      <MyReports />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

**Issue:**
The `ProtectedRoute` component has logic (lines 39-42) that redirects mayors to `/mayor/dashboard` if they try to access routes that are not marked as `mayorOnly` or `adminOrMayor`:

```javascript
// Redirect mayors to their dashboard if they try to access non-mayor routes
if (!mayorOnly && !adminOrMayor && user?.role === 'mayor') {
  return <Navigate to="/mayor/dashboard" replace />;
}
```

**Result:** When the mayor tried to access `/report` or `/my-reports`, they were immediately redirected back to the mayor dashboard.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code:
```javascript
<Route
  path="/report"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute citizenOnly>  // ‚úÖ Added citizenOnly flag
      <ReportIssue />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>

<Route
  path="/my-reports"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute citizenOnly>  // ‚úÖ Added citizenOnly flag
      <MyReports />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### What Changed:
Added the `citizenOnly` flag to both routes. This explicitly marks these pages as citizen-only functionality.

The `ProtectedRoute` component (lines 56-58) handles `citizenOnly` routes:
```javascript
if (citizenOnly && (isAdmin || user?.role === 'mayor')) {
  return <Navigate to={user?.role === 'mayor' ? '/mayor/dashboard' : '/admin/dashboard'} replace />;
}
```

## Design Intent

### For Citizens:
- ‚úÖ Can access `/report` to submit new issues
- ‚úÖ Can access `/my-reports` to view their submitted reports
- ‚úÖ Have "Report Issue" and "My Reports" buttons in navbar

### For Mayors:
- ‚ùå Should NOT access citizen report pages
- ‚úÖ Instead use mayor dashboard features:
  - **User Reports**: `/mayor/dashboard?tab=reports`
  - **View All Reports**: `/admin/reports`
- ‚úÖ These options available in profile dropdown menu (Navbar lines 362-381)

### For Admins:
- ‚ùå Should NOT access citizen report pages
- ‚úÖ Use admin dashboard:
  - **Analytics**: `/admin/dashboard`
  - **All Reports**: `/admin/reports`

---

## Navigation Flow

### Citizen Accessing /report:
```
Citizen clicks "Report Issue"
    ‚Üì
Navigate to /report
    ‚Üì
ProtectedRoute checks: citizenOnly flag is TRUE
    ‚Üì
User is citizen (not admin, not mayor)
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ ReportIssue page loads
```

### Mayor Accessing /report:
```
Mayor tries to access /report
    ‚Üì
ProtectedRoute checks: citizenOnly flag is TRUE
    ‚Üì
User is mayor (line 56-58 check)
    ‚Üì
‚ùå Redirected to /mayor/dashboard
```

### Admin Accessing /my-reports:
```
Admin tries to access /my-reports
    ‚Üì
ProtectedRoute checks: citizenOnly flag is TRUE
    ‚Üì
User is admin (line 56-58 check)
    ‚Üì
‚ùå Redirected to /admin/dashboard
```

## Mayor's Proper Workflow

### To View Reports:
1. **Option 1**: Click profile dropdown ‚Üí "User Reports"
   - Goes to `/mayor/dashboard?tab=reports`
   - Shows all citizen reports with filtering

2. **Option 2**: Click profile dropdown ‚Üí "View All Reports"
   - Goes to `/admin/reports`
   - Shows comprehensive admin view of all reports

### To Submit Issues (if needed):
Mayors typically don't submit issues like citizens. They oversee and manage the system. If a mayor needs to report something, they should:
1. Use their mayor account to coordinate with departments via chat
2. Or create a separate citizen account for personal reporting

---

## Navbar Behavior

### Desktop Navbar (Lines 84-124):
- **Admin**: Shows "Analytics" and "All Reports"
- **Citizen**: Shows "Dashboard", "Report Issue", "My Reports"
- **Mayor**: Shows only "Chat" and notification bell (no report buttons)

### Profile Dropdown (Lines 342-381):
- **Citizen**: Shows "Dashboard" and "My Reports"
- **Admin**: Shows "Dashboard" only
- **Mayor**: Shows "Dashboard", "User Reports", and "View All Reports"

### ProtectedRoute Logic (App.jsx lines 24-60):
```javascript
const ProtectedRoute = ({ 
  children, 
  adminOnly = false, 
  mayorOnly = false, 
  adminOrMayor = false, 
  citizenOnly = false 
}) => {
  // ... authentication checks ...
  
  // Redirect mayors to their dashboard if they try to access non-mayor routes
  if (!mayorOnly && !adminOrMayor && user?.role === 'mayor') {
    return <Navigate to="/mayor/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  
  // ... other checks ...
  
  if (citizenOnly && (isAdmin || user?.role === 'mayor')) {
    return <Navigate to={user?.role === 'mayor' ? '/mayor/dashboard' : '/admin/dashboard'} replace />;
  }
  
  return children;
};
```
