# Admin Inter-Department Chat Feature

## Overview
Added the ability for admins to chat with other departments and the mayor for coordination and support. This enables cross-departmental communication and direct access to the mayor's office.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### AdminDashboard (`client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- **Added "Department Chats" button** in the header
- Button links to `/chat` page
- Styled with gradient and hover effects
- Includes MessageCircle icon for visual clarity

#### Chat Page (`client/src/pages/Chat.jsx`)
- **Enabled "New Chat" button for admins** (previously only for citizens)
- **Updated new chat modal** to show appropriate departments:
  - Admins can select Mayor Office
  - Admins can select other departments (excluding their own)
  - Added helpful info message for admins
  - Added emojis for better visual identification
- **Enhanced chat list display**:
  - Shows user role (admin/mayor) next to username
  - Better identification of who you're chatting with

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Chat Routes (`server/routes/chat.js`)
- **Updated `/api/chat/start` endpoint**:
  - Now accepts both citizens and admins
  - Prevents admins from chatting with their own department
  - Stores user role and department in chat document
  - Allows admins to initiate chats with other departments and mayor

#### Chat Model (`server/models/Chat.js`)
- **Added new fields**:
  - `userRole`: Tracks if chat initiator is citizen/admin/mayor
  - `userDepartment`: Stores admin's department (null for citizens)
- These fields help identify the chat participants and enable proper routing
