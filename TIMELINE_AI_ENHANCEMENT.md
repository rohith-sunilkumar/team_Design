### 2. Human-Like Expert Thinking

**System Prompt Enhancement:**
```
You think and respond like an experienced municipal operations expert 
who has worked in city services for 20+ years.
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Real-world experience with civic issue resolution
- Ability to assess issue severity
- Understanding of how weather, resources, and priorities affect timelines
- Ability to explain "why" things take time, not just "how long"

### 3. Timeline Response Guidelines

**AI is instructed to:**

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - "How large is the pothole?"
   - "Is it causing immediate danger?"
   - "How many people are affected?"

2. **Provide Specific Timelines**
   - Not just "3-5 days"
   - But "A small pothole takes 2-3 days, but a large dangerous one gets fixed in 24-48 hours"

3. **Explain WHY**
   - Crew availability
   - Weather conditions
   - Complexity of repair
   - Safety protocols
   - Department workload

4. **Mention Factors**
   - What could speed up resolution
   - What could delay it
   - How to get priority treatment

5. **Give Realistic Expectations**
   - "Typically 3-5 days, but could be faster if marked high priority"
   - Acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate

6. **Provide Context**
   - Compare similar vs different scenarios
   - Explain prioritization logic
   - Share department constraints

### 4. Example Responses

#### User: "How long does it take to fix a pothole?"

**Old Response (Generic):**
```
Potholes typically take 3-5 days to fix depending on priority.
```

**New Response (Human Expert):**
```
‚è±Ô∏è Great question! The timeline for pothole repair depends on the size 
and severity:

**Timeline by Size:**
‚Ä¢ Small pothole (< 6 inches): 2-3 days
‚Ä¢ Medium pothole (6-12 inches): 3-5 days
‚Ä¢ Large pothole (> 12 inches): 5-7 days
‚Ä¢ Dangerous/blocking traffic: 24-48 hours

**Why the difference?**
The Road Service Department prioritizes potholes based on safety risk. 
A small pothole in a quiet residential street gets scheduled with 
regular maintenance (2-3 days). But if a pothole is causing accidents 
or blocking a major road, it becomes high priority and gets emergency 
crews within 24-48 hours.

**Factors that affect timing:**
- Traffic volume on that road
- Weather (rain delays asphalt work)
- Crew availability
- Size and depth of damage
- Safety hazards present

**Pro tip:** When reporting, mention if it's causing danger or affecting 
many people - this helps the department prioritize correctly!

Want me to give you a more specific estimate? Tell me:
1. How large is the pothole?
2. Is it on a busy street?
3. Is it causing any safety issues?
```

#### User: "My water pipe burst! How long until it's fixed?"

**New Response (Emergency Expert):**
```
üö® A burst pipe is a HIGH PRIORITY emergency!

**Expected Timeline: 2-6 hours**

Here's what happens:
1. **Immediate dispatch** (within 30 minutes)
2. **Crew arrival** (30-60 minutes)
3. **Water shutoff** (15-30 minutes)
4. **Repair work** (1-4 hours depending on damage)

**Why it's fast:**
Burst pipes get emergency response because they:
- Cause property damage
- Affect water supply to multiple homes
- Can undermine road foundations
- Create safety hazards

**What you should do NOW:**
1. ‚úÖ Call Water Management Emergency: (555) 123-4568
2. ‚úÖ Turn off main water valve if accessible
3. ‚úÖ Move valuables away from water
4. ‚úÖ Report on portal (mark as HIGH PRIORITY)
5. ‚úÖ Take photos for insurance

**Factors that could affect timing:**
- Location accessibility
- Extent of pipe damage
- Number of properties affected
- Weather conditions
- Time of day (night calls take slightly longer)

The crew will work continuously until it's fixed - burst pipes don't 
wait for business hours!

Need the emergency number again? (555) 123-4568
```

### 5. Factors Database

Each issue type includes factors that affect resolution time:

**Potholes:**
- Size and depth
- Traffic volume
- Weather conditions
- Location accessibility
- Available crew

**Water Leaks:**
- Leak severity
- Number of affected properties
- Water pressure
- Pipe accessibility
- Emergency status

**Streetlights:**
- Number of lights affected
- Area safety level
- Bulb vs wiring issue
- Weather conditions
- Pole accessibility

### 6. Real-World Context

**AI understands:**
- Crews prioritize based on safety, not first-come-first-served
- Weather delays outdoor work
- Emergency issues get 24/7 response
- Non-emergency issues wait for business hours
- Multiple similar issues in one area get batched
- Complex repairs need permits and planning

### 7. Proactive Clarification

**AI asks follow-up questions:**
- "To give you an accurate timeline, can you tell me how severe the issue is?"
- "Is this causing immediate danger to anyone?"
- "How many people or properties are affected?"
- "Have you marked it as high priority when reporting?"

## Comparison

### Before (Generic AI)
```
User: "How long to fix a pothole?"
AI: "Potholes typically take 3-5 days to fix."
```

### After (Human Expert AI)
```
User: "How long to fix a pothole?"
AI: "Great question! It depends on the size and severity:

‚Ä¢ Small pothole (< 6"): 2-3 days
‚Ä¢ Medium pothole (6-12"): 3-5 days
‚Ä¢ Large pothole (> 12"): 5-7 days
‚Ä¢ Dangerous/blocking traffic: 24-48 hours

The Road Service Department prioritizes based on safety risk. 
A small pothole in a quiet street gets scheduled with regular 
maintenance, but dangerous potholes on busy roads get emergency 
crews within 24-48 hours.

To give you a more specific estimate, can you tell me:
1. How large is the pothole?
2. Is it on a busy street?
3. Is it causing safety issues?"
```
