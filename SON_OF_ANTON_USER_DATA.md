## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

1. **New Service: `aiChatWithUserData.js`**
   - Fetches user data from database
   - Queries all department report collections
   - Retrieves chats and reviews
   - Generates statistics
   - Uses OpenAI (if available) or fallback responses

2. **Optional Authentication Middleware: `optionalAuth.js`**
   - Allows requests with or without authentication
   - Sets `req.user` if token is valid
   - Doesn't block unauthenticated requests

3. **Updated AI Chat Route: `aiChat.js`**
   - Uses optional authentication
   - Routes to user data service if logged in
   - Falls back to regular AI for non-logged-in users

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated `AIChatWidget.jsx`**
   - Sends authentication token with requests
   - Updated welcome message to mention user data
   - Changed quick questions to user-specific queries

### Database Queries

Son of Anton queries the following:
- **Reports**: All 5 department collections (roadservicereports, watermanagementreports, etc.)
- **Chats**: User's chat conversations
- **Reviews**: User's submitted reviews
